# Opnosis Auction — Terms of Service

**Last Updated: February 26, 2026**

These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the Opnosis Auction protocol interface ("Interface"), including any associated software, tools, and documentation (collectively, the "Service"). By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Service.

---

## 1. Overview

Opnosis Auction is a decentralized batch auction protocol deployed on Bitcoin Layer 1 via the OP_NET virtual machine. The Interface is a web-based frontend that allows users to interact with the Opnosis Auction smart contract. The Interface does not custody funds, execute trades, or control the underlying protocol.

## 2. Eligibility

By using the Service, you represent and warrant that:

- You are at least 18 years of age or the age of legal majority in your jurisdiction.
- You have the legal capacity to enter into these Terms.
- You are not located in, incorporated in, or a citizen or resident of any jurisdiction where use of the Service would be prohibited or would require licensing, registration, or authorization.
- You are not subject to economic sanctions or listed on any prohibited party list maintained by any governmental authority.
- Your use of the Service complies with all applicable laws and regulations in your jurisdiction.

## 3. The Protocol and the Interface

### 3.1 Protocol vs. Interface

The Opnosis Auction protocol consists of smart contracts deployed on the OP_NET network on Bitcoin Layer 1. The protocol is autonomous, permissionless, and not controlled by any single party once deployed. The Interface is merely a convenience tool that facilitates interaction with the protocol. You may interact with the protocol through other means, including direct contract calls.

### 3.2 Non-Custodial

The Service is entirely non-custodial. At no point does the Interface take custody of your assets, private keys, or wallet credentials. All transactions are executed on-chain through your own wallet (OP_WALLET). You retain full control and responsibility over your funds at all times.

### 3.3 No Financial Advice

Nothing in the Service constitutes financial advice, investment advice, trading advice, or any other form of professional advice. You are solely responsible for evaluating the risks and merits of any transaction you execute through the Interface.

## 4. Wallet Connection

To use the Service, you must connect a compatible OP_WALLET browser extension. By connecting your wallet, you acknowledge that:

- You are the rightful owner or authorized user of the connected wallet.
- All transactions initiated through the Interface require your explicit approval via the wallet extension.
- You are responsible for maintaining the security of your wallet, private keys, and any recovery phrases.
- We have no ability to recover lost keys, reverse transactions, or access your wallet.

## 5. Auction Participation

### 5.1 Creating Auctions

When you create an auction through the Interface, you are initiating an on-chain transaction that deploys auction parameters to the Opnosis Auction smart contract. Once submitted and confirmed on-chain, auction parameters cannot be modified through the Interface.

### 5.2 Placing Bids

When you place a bid (sell order) in an auction, you are committing tokens to the smart contract. Bids are subject to the auction's rules as encoded in the smart contract, including minimum bid amounts, cancellation deadlines, and settlement logic.

### 5.3 Settlement and Claims

Auction settlement and token claims are executed by the smart contract according to its programmed logic. The Interface displays settlement results but does not control or influence the settlement process.

### 5.4 Fees

The Opnosis Auction protocol may charge fees on auction settlement as encoded in the smart contract. Fee parameters are visible through the Interface and on-chain. The Interface does not charge any additional fees.

## 6. Prohibited Uses

You agree not to use the Service to:

- Violate any applicable law, regulation, or ordinance.
- Engage in market manipulation, wash trading, or any form of deceptive trading activity.
- Circumvent or attempt to circumvent any access restrictions or security measures.
- Interfere with or disrupt the Service, servers, or networks connected to the Service.
- Use the Service to launder money or finance terrorism.
- Use automated bots, scripts, or other tools to interact with the Interface in a manner that degrades performance for other users, except for standard programmatic interaction with the underlying smart contract.
- Misrepresent your identity or affiliation.

## 7. Risks

You acknowledge and accept the following risks associated with using the Service:

### 7.1 Smart Contract Risk

The Opnosis Auction smart contract may contain bugs, vulnerabilities, or unintended behavior. While the code has been reviewed, no audit can guarantee the absence of all defects. You may lose some or all of your funds due to smart contract failures.

### 7.2 Blockchain Risk

Transactions on Bitcoin Layer 1 and OP_NET are irreversible once confirmed. Network congestion, reorganizations, or protocol changes may affect transaction execution and timing.

### 7.3 Market Risk

Token values are volatile and unpredictable. Auction clearing prices may differ significantly from market prices. You may receive fewer tokens than expected or lose value on your participation.

### 7.4 Regulatory Risk

The regulatory status of decentralized protocols and digital assets varies by jurisdiction and may change. You are responsible for understanding and complying with applicable laws.

### 7.5 Interface Availability

The Interface may be unavailable due to maintenance, technical issues, or other factors. The underlying protocol remains accessible through direct contract interaction regardless of Interface availability.

## 8. Intellectual Property

The Interface source code, design, and documentation are provided under the terms of their respective licenses. The Opnosis Auction name and branding are proprietary. You may not use the Opnosis Auction name or branding to imply endorsement or affiliation without prior written consent.

IN NO EVENT SHALL OUR TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE SERVICE EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU PAID TO US IN THE TWELVE MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM, OR ONE HUNDRED US DOLLARS ($100), WHICHEVER IS LESS.

## 13. Severability

If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.

## 14. Governing Law
